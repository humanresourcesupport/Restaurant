The website emphasizes a dark, elegant color scheme for a premium user experience and features smooth transitions for a polished feel.

## ✨ Features

* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for all screen sizes (mobile-first approach).
* **Sticky Navigation:** Header remains visible for easy access to all sections.
* **Smooth Scrolling:** JavaScript implemented for smooth transitions between sections.
* **Aesthetic Focus:** Utilizes a dark color palette (charcoal and amber) for a luxurious look.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Structure and content definition.

* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Client-side functionality (mobile menu toggle, smooth scrolling).
* **CSS Customization:** Minor custom CSS for fixed header height and section spacing.

## 📂 File Structure

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `index.html` | The main website page containing all HTML structure and CDN links. |
| `script.js` | JavaScript code for smooth scrolling and mobile navigation logic. |
| `README.md` | This file: Project description and setup instructions. |
| `placeholder-hero.jpg` | Placeholder for the main hero background image. |
| `placeholder-chef.jpg` | Placeholder for the About Us section image. |

## 🚀 How to Run

No build tools or command line installations are needed.

1.  **Save Files:** Ensure `index.html` and `script.js` are saved in the same directory.
2.  **Open:** Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## 🎨 Customization Notes

* **Color Scheme:** The main accent color is defined by Tailwind's `text-amber-500` and `bg-amber-500`. These can be globally replaced (e.g., with `text-blue-500`) to change the branding color easily.
* **Fonts:** The design uses the standard system `font-sans` for body text and a placeholder `font-serif` for headers. For a production site, link a custom Google Font in the `<head>` of `index.html`.
* **Images:** Replace the placeholder file paths (`placeholder-hero.jpg`, `placeholder-chef.jpg`) with actual, high-quality restaurant images for a professional look.
